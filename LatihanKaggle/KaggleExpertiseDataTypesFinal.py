"""# üå∂Ô∏è Question 5

You own an online shop where you sell rings with custom engravings.  You offer both gold plated and solid gold rings.
- Gold plated rings have a base cost of \\$50, and you charge \\$7 per engraved unit.  
- Solid gold rings have a base cost of \\$100, and you charge \\$10 per engraved unit.
- Spaces and punctuation are counted as engraved units.

Write a function `cost_of_project()` that takes two arguments:
- `engraving` - a Python string with the text of the engraving
- `solid_gold` - a Boolean that indicates whether the ring is solid gold

It should return the cost of the project.  This question should be fairly challenging, and you may need a hint.
